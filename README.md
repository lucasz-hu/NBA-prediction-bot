# NBA Prediction Bot (Still a WIP)

## This is my NBA prediction bot that utilizes the four factors of basketball

### To start, download this project. Then run `calculate_score()`. First parameter is home team, second parameter is away team, third parameter is year (optional, default value 2021)

### Program will then output either a position or negative number. Positive means home team favored, negative number means away team favored. Note: There is no home-field advantage. Apply it how you want.
